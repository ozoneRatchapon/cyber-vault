### 4. docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md (This File)
**Purpose**: Documentation organization guide
**Audience**: Project maintainers and documentation contributors
**Content**:
- Overview of documentation structure
- Purpose and scope of each document
- Guidelines for maintaining separation of concerns
- Documentation maintenance best practices

## Documentation Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **README.md**: Focus on user experience and onboarding
- **SMART_CONTRACT.md**: Focus on technical implementation details
- **INSTRUCTION_REVIEW.md**: Focus on security and testing verification

### Avoiding Duplication
- High-level concepts: README.md
- Technical implementation: SMART_CONTRACT.md
- Security analysis: INSTRUCTION_REVIEW.md
- Cross-references provided between documents for navigation

### Maintenance Guidelines
1. **Update README.md** when adding user-facing features
2. **Update SMART_CONTRACT.md** when changing technical implementation
3. **Update INSTRUCTION_REVIEW.md** when adding tests or security measures
4. **Cross-reference** related content between documents
5. **Keep content focused** on the primary purpose of each document
