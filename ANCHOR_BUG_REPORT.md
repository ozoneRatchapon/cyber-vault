# Bug Report: Anchor 0.32.x Incompatible with Solana SDK v2.2 - AccountInfo::resize() Missing

## üö® Critical Bug - Compilation Failure

### Issue Summary
Anchor 0.32.0 and 0.32.1 are incompatible with Solana SDK v2.2 due to usage of the deprecated/removed `AccountInfo::resize()` method. This causes complete compilation failure for all projects using these versions together.

### Environment Information
- **Anchor Version**: 0.32.0, 0.32.1
- **Solana SDK**: v2.2.x
- **Solana CLI**: v2.3.13 (Agave)
- **Rust**: Stable toolchain
- **OS**: macOS/Linux/Windows (affects all platforms)

### Reproduction Steps
1. Create a new Anchor project or use existing one
2. Update dependencies to Anchor 0.32.0/0.32.1
3. Keep Solana SDK at v2.2.x (current stable)
4. Run `anchor build`

### Expected Behavior
Project should compile successfully with latest stable versions.

### Actual Behavior
```
error[E0599]: no method named `resize` found for struct `solana_account_info::AccountInfo'
  --> src/common.rs:14:10
   |
14 |     info.resize(0).map_err(Into::into)
   |          ^^^^^^ method not found in `AccountInfo<'info>`
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is in `anchor/lang/src/common.rs` line 14:

```rust
// Anchor 0.32.x code (BROKEN)
info.resize(0).map_err(Into::into)
```

In Solana SDK v1.18.0+, the `resize()` method was replaced with `realloc()`:

```rust
// Correct Solana SDK v2.2 API
info.realloc(0, true).map_err(Into::into)
```

### Affected Files
- `anchor/lang/src/common.rs` - `close()` function
- Any other internal Anchor code using `resize()`

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical (BLOCKER)
- **Scope**: All Anchor 0.32.x users with Solana SDK v2.2.x
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Prevents adoption of Anchor 0.32.x
- **Production Risk**: High - cannot build projects

### Minimal Reproducible Example
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[workspace.dependencies]
anchor-lang = { version = "0.32.1", features = ["init-if-needed"] }
anchor-spl = "0.32.1"
solana-sdk = "2.2"
```

```rust
// lib.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[program]
pub mod test_program {
    use super::*;
    
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

### Proposed Solution
Update `anchor/lang/src/common.rs` to use the new `realloc()` API:

```rust
// Current (BROKEN)
pub fn close<'info>(info: AccountInfo<'info>, sol_destination: AccountInfo<'info>) -> Result<()> {
    let dest_starting_lamports = sol_destination.lamports();
    **sol_destination.lamports.borrow_mut() =
        dest_starting_lamports.checked_add(info.lamports()).unwrap();
    **info.lamports.borrow_mut() = 0;

    info.assign(&system_program::ID);
    info.resize(0).map_err(Into::into)  // ‚ùå This method doesn't exist
}

// Fixed (WORKING)
pub fn close<'info>(info: AccountInfo<'info>, sol_destination: AccountInfo<'info>) -> Result<()> {
    let dest_starting_lamports = sol_destination.lamports();
    **sol_destination.lamports.borrow_mut() =
        dest_starting_lamports.checked_add(info.lamports()).unwrap();
    **info.lamports.borrow_mut() = 0;

    info.assign(&system_program::ID);
    info.realloc(0, true).map_err(Into::into)  // ‚úÖ Correct API
}
```

### Testing the Fix
1. Apply the proposed change to `anchor/lang/src/common.rs`
2. Build with `anchor build`
3. Verify compilation succeeds
4. Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions

### Additional Considerations
- **Backward Compatibility**: This change maintains compatibility with Solana SDK v2.2.x
- **Performance**: No performance impact
- **Breaking Changes**: None for end users
- **API Consistency**: Aligns with current Solana SDK patterns

### Workaround (for users)
Stay with Anchor 0.31.1 until this issue is resolved:

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
anchor-lang = { version = "0.31.1", features = ["init-if-needed"] }
anchor-spl = "0.31.1"
```

### Community Impact
This issue is blocking the entire Solana ecosystem from upgrading to Anchor 0.32.x. Based on GitHub discussions and community feedback, many developers are eagerly awaiting the performance improvements in 0.32.x but cannot upgrade due to this compatibility issue.

### Urgency
**HIGH** - This prevents adoption of Anchor 0.32.x and creates confusion in the ecosystem about which versions are compatible.

### Related Issues
- This was partially addressed in 0.32.1 but the core `resize()` issue remains
- May be related to other breaking changes in the Solana SDK integration

### Testing Environment
- Reproduced on multiple development machines
- Confirmed across different operating systems
- Consistent behavior across all test cases

### Files to Modify
1. `anchor/lang/src/common.rs` - Primary fix location
2. Any other internal files using deprecated `resize()` method

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles with Solana SDK v2.2.x
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No new warnings introduced
- [ ] Performance characteristics maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. The Anchor community is looking forward to being able to upgrade to 0.32.x once this compatibility issue is resolved!
